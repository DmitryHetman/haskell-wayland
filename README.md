# Haskell Wayland bindings #
Uh... these are what you'd expect.

## TODO ##
- prettify binding to wl_registry.bind (ie make more type-safe, add haskell documentation, etc)
- fix exposed symbols
- some kind of fancy FRP library binding?
- write documentation strings from .protocol files into haddock???
- allow easy building of other .protocol files into haskell bindings
- write README documentation detailing general binding strategy
- protocol version checker function
